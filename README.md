SRecord
=======

#### A simple persistence layer written in Scala ####

* An experiment in structuring database / table / rows as dependent objects
  (Cake pattern)
* Pretty much incomplete with respect to mature ORMs
* Nevertheless, I use it successfully in personal apps

See src/test for examples.

### Target platform ###

* Scala 2.7.4+
* JVM 1.5+
